2 types of Referencing

- RELATIVE REFERENCES -
= the reference is relative to the location of the cell.
Means that, When you copy a formula that contains a relative cell reference, that reference in the formula will change
For example, =B1+B2 will change the formula if you drag it to the next cell to become =B2+B3

- ABSOLUTE REFERENCES - ($) - dollar sign
= the reference is remain the same as the first cell
Means that, when you tried to copy paste the data to the next cell, the data still comeout the same amount.
For example, =$A$4+$A$5, if A4=7 & A5=8, the answer will be 15
If you drag it to the next cell, the answer still the same which is 15

- MIXED REFERENCES
= the reference will remain and will change
Means that, the data contain both, RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE references
For example, =$A$4+$A5, if A4=7 & A5=8, the answer will be 15, next cell add up 1 number.
$A$4 no change, $A5 will change.
